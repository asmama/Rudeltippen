In versions before 1.1.0 the results where not updated automatically, due to different reasons:

- The API from OpenLigaDB did change
- There was a bug in Rudeltippen which lead to a null pointer exception when the Webservice was contacted
- Due to some refactoring the webserviceID for the games were not stored correctly in the database when the original EM 2012 data was loaded

With version 1.1.0 the API changes were made and the the bug in Rudeltippen was fixed.

However, for the result updates to work correctly the games need a reference to the matchID at OpenLigaDB.

With version 1.1.0 there is a new update service available which contains the latest play schedule updates including the matchID required for OpenLigaDB.
You can either update your database manually or use the automatic update service build in Rudeltippen as of version 1.1.0.

Manual update
======================

You can get the latest play schedule update ready to paste in your database from the following URL:

http://api.rudeltippen.de/updates/all/<LEAGUENAME>

LEAGUENAME = e.g. em2012

Automatic update
======================

By default the automatic play schedule update is not enabled. To enable this feature you need to add the following line to your INSTALLATIONFOLDER/application.conf

%prod.automatic.updates=true

You need to restart Rudeltippen in order to enable the new feature.

The automatic update service will contact the API every hour against to check if updates available.
