There have been some changes in version 1.2.0 for custom configuration files making updates a little bit easier.

Until version 1.2.0 custom configuration files, like cert.txt and key.txt for SSL configuration, were located directly in /conf.
With version 1.2.0 all custom files have been moved to /conf/custom. Thus, if you have one of the custom files configured, you need to
move them to /conf/custom and change your application.conf accordingly. 

This has the advantage that you can backup your application.conf and the complete /custom folder before installation a new version. 
After installing the new version you can simple paste backup of application.conf and your /custom folder back to /conf.
