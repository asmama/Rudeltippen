Installation
===========

This installation guide assumes that you already have JDK 1.6+ running, have your Database configured and your SMTP-Credentials right at your side.

1. Download [Play Framework 1.2.x][2] and unzip
------------------

For convenience, you should add the framework installation directory to your system PATH. On UNIX systems will be something like:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/play
```

On windows systems you'll need to set it in the global environment variables.

> If you’re on UNIX, make sure that the play script is executable (otherwise do a chmod a+x play).

2. Download the current Version of Rudeltippen and unzip
------------------

3. Open <INSTLLATIONFOLDER>/conf/application.conf
------------------

Set your URL

```bash
%prod.app.register.url=http://www.mydomain.com
```

Set the Username and Password for inital setup

```bash
app.setup.username=admin
app.setup.password=secretpassword
```

Set you Database connection. For a simple MySQL-Connection this will be something like this

```bash
%prod.db=mysql://user:pwd@host/database
```

Set your SMTP-Credentials

```bash
%prod.mail.smtp.host=127.0.0.1
%prod.mail.smtp.user=admin
%prod.mail.smtp.pass=
#%prod.mail.smtp.channel=ssl
```

Set your E-Mail-Sender

```bash
mailservice.replyto=me@example.de
mailservice.from=Rudelmail <me@example.de>
```

Set the Twitter-Feed which is displayed at the Dashboard. Leave Blank, if you dont want that Feature

```bash
dashboard.twitter.username=mytwitterusername
```

Save the file.

4. Follow the Section ['Front-end HTTP server' on the Play Framework Documentation][9] to set up your Fron-end HTTP Server with Rudeltippen.
------------------

> By default Rudeltippen runs on Port 9000

5. Go to your Installation-Directory and run
------------------

```bash
play id prod
```

Now that we have Play in Production mode, we have to Download the Dependecies. Run

```bash
play deps --sync
```

Finally we are ready to start-up Rudeltippen. Unix and Mac users can start Rudeltippen with

```bash
play start
```

If you’re on Windows, 'play start' will execute Rudeltippen in the current Command-Window. Thus, closing the Window will close Rudeltippen. Download and Install psexec and start Rudeltippen with

```bash
/path/to/psexec/psexec.exe /path/to/play/play.bat start /path/to/rudeltippen
```

6. Open your Browser and go to http://yourdomain.com/setup
------------------

> You did set username and password in application.conf (see 3.)

7. Change the default values if you want to and create an inital user.
------------------

> The inital user will be an administrative user and automaticly activated.

8. Enjoy Rudeltippen!
