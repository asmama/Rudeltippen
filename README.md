Installation
===========

This installation guide assumes that you already have JDK 1.6+ installed and have your database- and SMTP credentials right beside you.

Step 1
------------------

Download the [latest tagged version of Rudeltippen][14] and unzip to your INSTLLATIONFOLDER

Step 2
------------------

Open INSTLLATIONFOLDER/conf/application.conf

Set your Rudeltippen URL

```bash
%prod.app.register.url=http://www.yourdomain.com
```

Set the username and password for inital setup (make it "secure")

```bash
app.setup.username=admin
app.setup.password=admin
```

Set the language for Rudeltippen (currently de or en)

```bash
default.language=de
```

Since version 1.1.0 Rudeltippen has a feature which can automaticly updates your playing schedule. By default this feature is not enable. If you want to enable this feature set 'automatic.updates' to true

```bash
%prod.automatic.updates=false
```

Set the application key for rudeltippen (make it "secure")

```bash
application.secret=yoursecretcryptographicskey
```

Set you database connection. For a simple MySQL connection this will be something like this

```bash
%prod.db=mysql://user:pwd@host/database
```

Set your SMTP credentials (uncomment %prod.mail.smtp.channel if you want to use SSL)

```bash
%prod.mail.smtp.host=127.0.0.1
%prod.mail.smtp.user=admin
%prod.mail.smtp.pass=
#%prod.mail.smtp.channel=ssl
```

If you have a Gmail account, just enter your SMTP credentials as follows

```bash
%prod.mail.smtp.host=smtp.gmail.com
%prod.mail.smtp.user=yourGmailLogin
%prod.mail.smtp.pass=yourGmailPassword
%prod.mail.smtp.channel=ssl
```

Set your E-Mail-Sender and reply-to address

```bash
mailservice.replyto=me@example.de
mailservice.from=Rudelmail <me@example.de>
```

By default Rudeltippen runs with -Xmx=128m -Xmx64m. This just be enough for arroung 50 to 100 users. Change this, if required.

```bash
jvm.memory=-Xmx128m -Xms64m
```

Save application.conf.

Step 3
------------------

Follow the section ['Front-end HTTP server' on the Play Framework Documentation][9] to set up your Fron-end HTTP Server with Rudeltippen.

> By default Rudeltippen runs on Port 1904. If you need to change this, you'll find the port configuration in application.conf under 'Server configuration'.

Step 4
------------------

> It will most likely be required to make startup.sh, shutdown.sh and INSTLLATIONFOLDER/play/play executable if you are on UNIX or Mac

You are now ready to start Rudeltippen. If you are on UNIX or Mac you can just run the following command in your INSTLLATIONFOLDER

```bash
startup.sh
```

If you’re on Windows, just calling 'startup.bat' will execute Rudeltippen in the current command window. Thus, closing the window will close Rudeltippen. To solve this, run the following VB-Script

```bash
rudeltippen.vbs /start
```

Step 5
------------------

Open your browser and go to http://yourdomain.com/system/setup

> You did set username and password in application.conf (see step 3)

Step 6
------------------

Change the default values if you want to and create an inital user.

> The inital user will be an administrative user and automaticly activated.
> After the setup is complete, Rudeltippen will automaticly load all data for the Euro 2012.

Step 7
------------------

Login with your just created user and enjoy Rudeltippen!

If you need to stop Rudeltippen. Got to your INSTLLATIONFOLDER and call

```bash
shutdown.sh
```

OR

```bash
rudeltippen.vbs /stop
```

Upgrading
===========

Step 0
------------------

Please check the release notes (if available) before updating!

Go to your INSTLLATIONFOLDER and make a copy of /conf/application.conf file and /conf/custom folder.

Step 1
------------------

Download the [latest tagged version of Rudeltippen][14]

Step 2
------------------

Go to your INSTLLATIONFOLDER and run

```bash
shutdown.sh
```

OR

```bash
rudeltippen.vbs /stop
```

Step 3
------------------

Completly delete your INSTLLATIONFOLDER

Step 4
------------------

Unzip the latest version of Rudeltippen to your INSTLLATIONFOLDER

Step 5
------------------

In Step 0 you did copy the application.conf and /custom folder from your previous installation, didn't you? Copy application.conf and /custom folder your INSTLLATIONFOLDER/conf and replace the existing file and folder. If you did not make a copy of application.conf, even though you were told to, you need to rerun Step 2 (and only step 2!) of the installation guide (see above) and re-customize your files in /conf/custom folder.

Step 6
------------------

Since version 1.1.0 Rudeltippen has a feature which can automaticly updates your playing schedule. By default this feature is not enable. If you want to enable this feature and are upgrading from a version prior to 1.1.0 you need to add the following line to your application.conf:

```bash
%prod.automatic.updates=true
```

Step 7
------------------

You are now ready to start Rudeltippen. If you are on UNIX or Mac you can just run the following command in your INSTLLATIONFOLDER

```bash
startup.sh
```

If you’re on Windows, just calling 'startup.bat' will execute Rudeltippen in the current command window. Thus, closing the window will close Rudeltippen. To solve this, run the following VB-Script

```bash
rudeltippen.vbs /start
```

Step 7
------------------

Enjoy your latest version of Rudeltippen!

Advanced configuration
===========

SSL
------------------

By default Rudeltippen runs without SSL. If you want to enable SSL for Rudeltippen you need a private key and a certificate (this may be self-signed). In INSTLLATIONFOLDER/conf/custom you find two empty files:

```bash
cert.txt
key.txt
```
Paste you private key and your certificate in these files.

Open INSTLLATIONFOLDER/conf/application.conf and uncommend the following lines:

```bash
#https.port=9904
#%prod.certificate.key.file=conf/custom/key.txt
#%prod.certificate.file=conf/custom/cert.txt
```

You need to restart Rudeltippen in order for the changes to take place. After the restart Rudeltippen listens for SSL-Connection on Port 9904. You will need to change your HTTP-Frontend Server settings accordingly. Edit or update your Proxy settings to connect to the new port. Read the documentation of your HTTP-Server on how to configure SSL Proxy support.

Twitter
------------------

Rudeltippen can automaticly post the following informations: daily top 3, results updated and new registration to a Twitter-Account. If you want to enable this feature you need a consumerkey, a consumersecret, a token and a secret. Open INSTLLATIONFOLDER/conf/application.conf, uncommend the following lines and paste your data:

```bash
#%prod.twitter.consumerkey=
#%prod.twitter.consumersecret=
#%prod.twitter.token=
#%prod.twitter.secret=
#%prod.twitter.enable=false
```

By default 'twitter.enable' is set to 'false'. Set it to 'true' to enable posting to the Twitter-Account.

You need to restart Rudeltippen in order for the changes to take place.

Log4j
------------------
If you want log4j Support for your Application you find an empty log4j configuration file in INSTLLATIONFOLDER/conf/custom. Edit this file with your required appenders and uncomment the following line in INSTLLATIONFOLDER/application.conf

```bash
#%prod.application.log.path=/custom/log4j.prod.xml
```

You need to restart Rudeltippen in order for the changes to take place.

Load balancer
------------------

As mentioned [in the Play documentation][9] you can use a load balancer with multiple Rudeltippen applications. You need to set a different port for each Rudeltippen application and set these ports in your Front-End HTTP Server configuration.
The jobs Rudeltippen executes do not know about how many instances you run and will by default run in each instance. To avoid this, you can set the name of the application- and the job-instance. Rudeltippen will only execute Jobs in an instance where the name of the appname and jobinstance matches.

```bash
application.name=rudeltippen
app.jobinstance=rudeltippen
```

You need to restart Rudeltippen in order for the changes to take place.
