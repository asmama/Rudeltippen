Installation
===========

This installation guide assumes that you already have JDK 1.6+ running, have your Database configured and your SMTP-Credentials right at your side.

1. Download [Play Framework 1.2.x][2] and unzip. From the Play Documentation:

For convenience, you should add the framework installation directory to your system PATH. On UNIX systems will be something like:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/play
```

On windows systems you'll need to set it in the global environment variables.

> If youâ€™re on UNIX, make sure that the play script is executable (otherwise do a chmod a+x play).

2. Download the current Version of Rudeltippen and unzip.

3. Open <INSTLLATIONFOLDER>/conf/application.conf
