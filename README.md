Installation
===========

This installation guide assumes that you already have JDK 1.6+ installed and running, and have your Database- and SMTP-Credentials right beside you.

Step 1
------------------

Download the latest version of Rudeltippen and unzip to your INSTLLATIONFOLDER

Step 2
------------------

Open INSTLLATIONFOLDER/conf/application.conf

Set your Rudeltippen URL

```bash
%prod.app.register.url=http://www.yourdomain.com
```

Set the Username and Password for inital setup

```bash
app.setup.username=admin
app.setup.password=admin
```
Set the application key for rudeltippen

```bash
application.secret=yoursecretcryptographicskey
```

Set you Database connection. For a simple MySQL-Connection this will be something like this

```bash
%prod.db=mysql://user:pwd@host/database
```

Set your SMTP-Credentials (uncomment %prod.mail.smtp.channel if you want to use SSL)

```bash
%prod.mail.smtp.host=127.0.0.1
%prod.mail.smtp.user=admin
%prod.mail.smtp.pass=
#%prod.mail.smtp.channel=ssl
```

Set your E-Mail-Sender and reply-to Address

```bash
mailservice.replyto=me@example.de
mailservice.from=Rudelmail <me@example.de>
```

Set the Twitter-Feed which is displayed at the Dashboard. Leave this blank, if you don't want that Feature.

```bash
dashboard.twitter.username=mytwitterusername
```

By defautl Rudeltippen runs with -Xmx=128m -Xmx64m. Change this if need.

```bash
jvm.memory=-Xmx128m -Xms64m
```

Save application.conf.

Step 3
------------------

Follow the Section ['Front-end HTTP server' on the Play Framework Documentation][9] to set up your Fron-end HTTP Server with Rudeltippen.

> By default Rudeltippen runs on Port 1904. If you need to change this, you'll find the Port Configuration in application.conf 'Server configuration'.

Step 4
------------------

You are now ready to start Rudeltippen. If you are on UNIX or Mac you can just run the following command in your INSTLLATIONFOLDER

```bash
startup.sh
```

If you’re on Windows, just calling 'startup.bat' will execute Rudeltippen in the current Command-Window. Thus, closing the Window will close Rudeltippen. To solve this issue, download and install [PsExec from the PsTools][10] and start Rudeltippen with

```bash
/path/to/psexec/psexec.exe /path/to/play/play.bat start /path/to/rudeltippen
```

Step 5
------------------

Open your Browser and go to http://yourdomain.com/setup

> You did set username and password in application.conf (see 3.)
> After the Setup is complete Rudeltippen will automaticly load all games for the Euro 2012.

Step 6
------------------

Change the default values if you want to and create an inital user.

> The inital user will be an administrative user and automaticly activated.
